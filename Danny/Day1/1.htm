        <h1>Welcome Danny</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to the Interface Danny!! This is how I will communicate with you as its secure. As you know all my peers attempting to track down the culprit have been taken off the board but we all understood
            that this might happen and took precausions. One hid there data inside a cookig recipe, two brothers liked there data systems each using games and each others computers to varify the user, and finaly the last one doesn't
            belive in security and gave me there password to there computer.
        </p>
        <p>Before I forget this is The Interface and it is how I will be comunicating with you as well as how I can get you acces to needed programs and computers without you haveing to know SSH proticalls.
            Somtimes you might need multiple people to work on something simulatiously and I will ether lock two or more of you together on your dayly interface or if it doesn't matter I will give the lead person on that
            task a 4 digit code per person that is required. If you are given a code click the link page and type in the code!! Not much to look at on The Interface I did not have time to make it functional and looking good.

        </p>
        <p>You and Dave will be working with the two brothers systems. Below are some inputs you can use!! Below those inputs are two links they will bring you to two different displays of one of the brothers computers. One is 
            attempting to accses the data of that brother and the other is linked to the security of the other brothers computer that Dave is set on getting into. I would open them in two browsers so you can work on yours and help
            Dave!! By the way you will want to use the browser on a laptop or PC!!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>WASD for contral on some games</li>
            <li>F for select</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <button onClick="Brother1_1()">Data Accses</button>
    <button onClick="Brother2_2()">Linked Security "other brother"</button>
